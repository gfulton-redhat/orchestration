**Immutable:** Not capable of or susceptible to change.

**Orchestration:** The planning or coordination of the elements of a situation to produce a desired effect.

## Tenants

* ***Single Source Of Truth***
* ***Roll Forward***
* ***Tracability*** What changed
* ***Accountablity*** Who changed
* ***Immutablity***

### Single Source Of Truth
A single source of truth is the practice of aggregating data to a single location where data be found via a single reference point.

* ***Configuration***
* ***Policies***
* ***Source Code***
* ***Reports***

### Always Roll Forward
Given our SSOT we are able to apply immutable changes


  
  
  
* The application repository should produce an immutable container image from source code. 
* The application configuration repository shall provide a default configuruations.
* The application policy respository shall provide default policies.
